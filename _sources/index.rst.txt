Documentation
+++++++++++++

Welcome to the KINOVA® KORTEX™ API documentation. If you are a newcomer, feel free to check our :doc:`installation procedure <getting_started/installation>`.
Once this is done, a good starting point would be the getting started section. It includes the :doc:`API mechanism <getting_started/api_mechanism>`,
the :doc:`error management <getting_started/error_management>` and some :doc:`code examples <getting_started/error_management>`.

This API uses `Google Protocol Buffer <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python-generated>`_ message objects1 to exchange data between client and server.

`Google Protocol Buffer <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python-generated>`_ offers structured data objects with standard methods for each member field:

* structured, nested objects
* basic types and collections
* getter/setter methods on basic types
* iterators, dimension and appending methods on collections
* many helpers (e.g. serialize/deserialize, I/O functions)

When using the Kortex API a developer will need to understand the `Google Protocol Buffer <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python-generated>`_ feature set to maximize their efficiency.
