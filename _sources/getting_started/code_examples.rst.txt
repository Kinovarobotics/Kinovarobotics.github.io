Code examples
=============
Welcome to the code examples. It is a good starting point if you want to learn how to initialize the kortex API and how to access its services.

Using a MQTT session
-----------------------
This piece of code shows how to initialize a session with the Kortex API using the MQTT transport. Once the session has been created, 
a client communicating with the base service is created and the function GetArmState() is executed. Once this is all done, everything is closed
smoothly using the correct teardown sequence.

Getting the robot feedback with a UDP session
-----------------------
This other piece of code shows how to initialize a session with the Kortex API using the UDP transport. Once the session has been created, 
a client communicating with the base cyclic service is created and the function RefreshFeedback() is executed. Once this is all done, everything is closed
smoothly using the correct teardown sequence.

Run a program
-----------------------
This example shows how to start a program that is already stored on the controller. It assumes that the controller and the robot has been 
powered on. Assign the program ID you want to start to this variable PROGRAM_ID. Once this is all done, everything is closed smoothly 
using the correct teardown sequence.
